# Serious SQL Video Game Training
This is the repo that has all the queries and data for my Serious SQL video game training series!

## Base Data Model (getting started)

1. Install Postgres locally (Homebrew is really nice for installing on Mac)
2. Use pg_restore to create a new database. 
```
pg_restore -U <your_username> -d <yourdb> -1 base-data-model/halo5-dump.sql
```
